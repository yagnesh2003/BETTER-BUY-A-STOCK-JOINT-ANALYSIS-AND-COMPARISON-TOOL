## Better Buy: A Stock Joint-Analysis and Comparison Tool
* "Better Buy" is an interactive tool I've created that performs joint analysis and comparisons of two tech companies' business strategies, stock performances, and growth opportunities and recommends the better stock to investors. This model also provides users with detailed visualizations of key growth, performance, and risk metrics to base their decisions.

* "Better Buy" consists of highly-detailed implementations of business and technical analysis strategies for both growth and value-driven investors. The tool's analytics capabilities rely on a number of scripts I've written totally from scratch.

* My tool also uses pandas and numPy for in-depth analysis, as well as matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization. I've also imported the yfinance library to access historical stock quotes.

* For this Notebook, I will be using my model to compare the two major fintech payment companies: Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL).

* Each of the four major sections (Business Strategy, Financial Strength & Growth, Risk vs. Return, and Valuation) will begin with a series of guided questions which serve as subtopics for my analysis.



* Performs complete comparisons of competitive strategy, financial strength, growth potential, and valuation of two companies through fundamental and technical analysis.
* Wrote data parser and reader to download 10-Q and 10-K SEC filings and store them in pandas DataFrame, as well as scripts to append certain business performance metrics for trend analysis.
* Designed risk-analysis models using Monte-Carlo Simulations and implemented visualizations using matplotlib and Seaborn.
* Combined data with experts' opinions and shareholder sentiment on business strategy and comapny/management direction to make final "better buy" decision.
